			“If Only I Could Understand Men….”<br><br><br>

Men always say they can’t understand women, and that women are so complicated. Well, for many women, it is the exact opposite.<br> Most would give anything to understand what makes men “tick.” Even though women want to know what he’s thinking, men are often reluctant to share what is in their hearts. What’s a woman to do?<br>

Rather than describe all the differences between the sexes, it is often more helpful to focus on a few areas that any woman can understand.<br>

<br>1) Men are more sensitive than women. While that might sound silly, the truth is that men don’t have the ability to recover from emotional trauma as effectively as a woman.<br> Because of this, men keep themselves from getting too upset. When a man hears he should just “let his feelings out,” what he translates that into is this, “If I let my feelings out, I might not be able to control them.”<br>

<br>2) Men hate fighting. For men, conflict is not simply resolving a problem. Fighting, to a man, means one has to win and the other needs to be totally defeated.<br> Men often prefer conflict that is non-emotional because it is less threatening to them. Once a conflict becomes emotionally charged, it is very difficult for a man to contain those feelings and the most frequent coping skill is for them to become quiet.<br> It may seem like they are punishing you, but they are most likely trying not to lose control.<br>

<br>3) Men want to get married. In spite of what many progressive cultures preach, the truth is that a majority of men in the world do get married.<br> While the freedom of being single has its appeal, it comes with one primary drawback – it is lonely. While this might not sound overly romantic, finding a woman that a man can trust is just as important as finding one who is beautiful.<br>

<br>If you liked these insights, there are more available in Bob Grant’s wonderful e-book called, “The Woman Men Adore…and Never Want to Leave.” <br>Bob Grant, P.L.C., has taken his 17 years of private practice as a Licensed Professional Counselor and Coach and condensed only the best information into a mouth-watering, powerful handbook on what men find themselves powerless to resist in a woman.<br> You can have this information simply by <a href="http://9f523e00ubw8axcbl0ga83azc9.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none">CLICKING HERE!</a>.. <br>

When it Comes to Men, Some Women Have It...and You Can Too! 

by Bob Grant, P.L.C. author of “The Woman Men Adore” <br>

Every day in my counseling office, I hear women say some variation of this: <br>

“In the last few years, I have had relationships with men who, at first, seemed perfect for me.  They were attentive, attractive and fun to be around. <br> Then suddenly, as if they knew they had reeled me in, they stopped trying.  They stopped calling as much, stopped taking me out and basically stopped the romantic dance that couples do when they are falling in love. <br> Was it me?  After all, I think I’m attractive, have a good personality and I work out to keep my body in nice shape.  So why then, do I always end up with the men who become “couch potatoes” at my house? <br> The men who would rather bring a six pack over and watch football all day and then expect me to fix dinner?  Do I suddenly turn into just a “buddy” to them, the girl next door?<br> 

I see other women who, frankly, are not as attractive as I am or as thin as I am, who seem to get the “hot” men. <br> I don’t necessarily mean gorgeous men, but the men who take them to nice restaurants, bring them flowers, take them dancing and, basically, “court” them.  What secrets do they know that I don’t, because they certainly aren’t sharing them?”<br>

Most women think a wonderful relationship is simply about finding the right man.<br> The truth is that those women who have wonderful relationships didn’t necessarily know where to find good men, instead they attracted them. Would you like to learn how to attract and keep a wonderful man? The best way to find out probably isn’t by talking to a woman; instead, a man would be able to give you the secrets to a man’s heart.<br>

I’d like to share with you the secrets that men find irresistible and powerless to resist. <br>The dirty little secret is that having a perfect body isn’t nearly as important as you have been led to believe. You can discover this incredible information by simply <a href="http://9f523e00ubw8axcbl0ga83azc9.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none">CLICKING HERE!</a>.
